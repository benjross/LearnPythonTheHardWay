This is the spec for the game I am developing.  It will be an extension of the
combat system I made for ex43.py.  It will be like Mortal Kombat I hope.  It
will feature a list of characters that the user can choose from, each with its
own set of moves.  I want to encorporate some ASCII animations too.  The REPL
will print out the scene and the characters health and attacks.  It will be a
text based combat system.
